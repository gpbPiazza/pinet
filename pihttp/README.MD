# PIHTTP

PIHTTP is my own implementation of a http 1.1 protocol, here I will implement and learn how http works and 
what is the rules that the server must follow in order to implement the http protocol. 

It is a http framework in Go? I don't know bro I am just fucking around here, if you think this code can be 
a http framework it is ok, for me I just want to learn how to implement de http protocol by my hands.
